# A case study about Fintech company
## This is my submission for Homework 01
**Libra**
* Libra is a permissioned blockchain digital currency proposed by the American social media company Facebook, Inc.
The Libra Association’s mission is to enable a simple global payment system and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.
The currency and network do not yet exist, and only rudimentary experimental code has been released. The launch is planned to be in 2020.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The Libra payment system is built on blockchain technology to enable the open, instant, and low-cost movement of money. People will be able to send, receive, and spend their money, enabling a more inclusive global financial system.

## Business Activities:

Facebook established the Libra Association to oversee the currency, founded in Geneva, Switzerland. Initial membership as of October 2019 was:
-	Payments: PayU Checkout.com
-	Technology and marketplaces: Facebook's subsidiary Novi Financial, Farfetch, Lyft, Spotify, Uber, Shopify

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
All people who wants a secure way to invest, transfer, and deal with money.
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The Libra mission is to enable a simple global payment system and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people. The Libra payment system will support single-currency stablecoins (e.g., ≋USD, ≋EUR, ≋GBP, etc.) and a multi-currency coin (≋LBR), which we refer to together as Libra Coins.
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
They are using Rust. Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, and provides memory safety without using garbage collection.
